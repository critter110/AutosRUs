    The independent variables considered in this regression model were: vehicle length, vehicle weight,
spoiler angle, and ground clearance. After using R's multiple regression function, and using a p-value
of less than 0.05 to be considered significant, the vehicle length (p = 3.05e-12), ground clearance 
(p = 2.13e-08), and to some extent vehicle weight (p = 0.073) were the variables that had the most 
impact on fuel efficiency. Also, the fact that the intercept is "significant" (p = 1.87e-08) means there
is some other variable that is contributing to the mpg that we are not accounting for. 
    The r^2 value given is 0.732 which means that there is a strong positive correlation. This along with 
the fact that the p value is 2.277e-11 (very significant) shows that the slope is not considered zero.
Since we have two variables with a p value greater than 0.05 and the p value of the intercept is very low
means that this model may not be the best at predicting our car's mpg. In order to get a better predicting
model, we would probably need to include whether the car is all wheel drive or not in our model.

    The summary table of the suspension PSI data shows that each of the three manufacturing lots are
producing suspensions that are on average very close to one another. However, the variance in the
data from lot 3 shows that lot 3 is inconsistent in their manufacturing. Their average is close
to the other lots, but they must have some bad outliers effecting the data. The variance of 220
from Lot3 is outside of company tolerances and must be addressed. 

Suspension T-test
    One of the requirements needed to perform a t-test is that the data is considered to be normally
distributed. So the first step was to use a shapiro-wilk test to confirm normalcy. The results of
this test gave a p-value of 6.011e-11. This is unfortunate because it means that the data is not 
normally distributed and therefore we cannot perform a t-test on this data. 


Design your own test
    My test will compare the crash test findings of our MechaCar versus other brand's cars. Our physical
test will be to crash the MechaCar and the other cars into a wall head on at 50mph and repeat 50 times. 
An accelerometer in the cars will measure the g-forces experienced by the car's passengers in the 
simulated crash. A lower g-force reading will mean a safer car for prospective customers. 
    The question we are asking is, is the mean g-force of MechaCar lower than the mean g-force of the 
other cars. The null hypothesis is that there is no statistical difference between MechaCar's mean g-force
and the other car's mean g-force. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant statistical
difference in the mean g-forces. To determine this, we will perform a two sample t-test to compare the 
different means.
